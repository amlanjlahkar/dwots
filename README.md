Dwots is the collecton of the configuration files and shell scripts
for the programs I use daily in my linux machine.
For handling of the file tree, I'm using GNU Stow.

To restore:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amlanjlahkar/dwots ~/dwots && cd ~/dwots
chmod u+x install.sh
./install.sh
```
(the installation script currently only works on Arch/Arch-based linux distributions)
