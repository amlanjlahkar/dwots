Dwots is the collecton of the configuration files and shell scripts
for the programs I use daily in my linux machine.
For handling of the file tree, I'm using GNU Stow.

To restore:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amlanjlahkar/dwots ~/dwots && cd ~/dwots
chmod u+x install.sh
./install.sh

# to remove symbolic links generated by stow inside of .config/
./install.sh -u
```

TODO
- [] install script: Fix the issue with group directories when it contains subdirs of different structures(i.e the shell directory)
