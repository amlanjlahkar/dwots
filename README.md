Dwots is the collecton of the configuration files and shell scripts
for the programs I use daily in my linux machine.
For handling of the file tree, I'm using GNU Stow.

To restore local files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amlanjlahkar/dwots ~/dwots && cd ~/dwots/home/
chmod u+x stowd
./stowd

# to remove symbolic links generated by stow inside of .config/
./stowd -U
```

TODO
  - [X] install script: Fix the issue with group directories when it contains subdirs of different structures(i.e the shell directory)
  - [ ] structure: manage non-local(outside of home) files with stow
